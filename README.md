## The Flamethrower is paired with a smartphone, that has a burner wallet.
This wallet also sends the request to the arduino for verification, it checks to see the presence of the NFT and if there allows the valve to open.

## Now we can quickly issue burnable tokens to folks to be used with the art piece.
